We were unable to get the mouse movements fully working. Therefore the only time mouse movements 
take effect are when you hit 'P' to go into perspective mode. Unfortunately we also couldn't 
complete the viewing transformations so you cant see anything in perspective mode. To see the 
results of the mouse movements go back to orthagonal mode by hitting 'P' again.
